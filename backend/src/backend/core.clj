;; Compojure will normally dereference deferreds and return the realized value.

;; deferred, we extend Compojure's `Renderable` protocol to pass the deferred

;; This handler defines a set of endpoints via Compojure's `routes` macro.  Notice that above
;; we've added the `GET` macro via `:refer` so it doesn't have to be qualified.  We wrap the
;; result in `ring.middleware.params/wrap-params` so that we can get the `count` parameter in
;; `streaming-numbers-handler`.
;;
;; Notice that at the bottom we define a default `compojure.route/not-found` handler, which
;; will return a `404` status.  If we don't do this, a call to a URI we don't recognize will
;; return a `nil` response, which will cause Aleph to log an error.
